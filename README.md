User Stories:
“As an active Kasper Dance Crew member, it would be nice to be able to log in to an account and be able to see additional information beyond just informational stuff that I already know about.”
“I think there should be a portal like other student orgs to eventually have any needed private information for active members like being able to sign up for specific events or being able to access a full photo repository.”
“I want to be able to favorite upcoming events I’m interested in attending and having a personal account will let me keep track of everything.”

SPRINT REVIEW REFLECTIONS
What did you learn in this sprint?
We learned that it is important to communicate with each other when collaborating on a project through GitHub. When connecting

What went well and why?
We were able to collaborate easily because of GitHub and look over each other's work. We were able to create our website to the satisfaction of our client by communicating and providing updates.

What challenges did you face?
We had some challenges navigating the connecting of our project to firebase because it has been a while since we’ve worked with it.
How will you improve next sprint?
Check in with the clients to see if they’re able to efficiently use the page and have their audiences utilize the sign in and sign up feature. Our group did a great job allocating work and checking in with each other so we will keep up our communication to improve our next sprint.
(If applicable) any client feedback
They love the new interface as the design and layout of the page suits what they had in mind.
